Interactive Control Structure Diagram

a web program that reads a programming code function, identifies the structure of the function and draws a diagram that describes the function's structure.
the diagram allows to learn about the function's structure and to detect duplicate/clone code.
duplicate code / clone code is a code that occurs many times within a program. duplicate code is undesirable for many reasons.
one of the reasons, if the programmer finds a bug in a duplicated code, or wants to do any change to the code, he will need to remember all the places the code occurs, and then change the code every place that the code occurs.
avoiding duplicate code makes it easier to the programmer to make changes when needed.
